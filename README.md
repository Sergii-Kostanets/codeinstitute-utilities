# **Utility Control 3**
'Utility Control 3' is an application that helps user to control your utility bills. This is the third project in the Full Stack Software Development course. And this is my third way to control my expenses. The first method of writing in a notepad is inconvenient. The second way - using mobile applications, is good, but I always dreamed of making a free system. And this third way - the program I wrote, is the first step towards fulfilling the dream of creating my application for controlling expenses.
