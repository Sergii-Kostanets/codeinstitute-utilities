# **Utility Control 3**

'Utility Control 3' is an application that helps user to control your utility bills. This is the third project in the Full Stack Software Development course. And this is my third way to control my expenses. The first method of writing in a notepad is inconvenient. The second way - using mobile applications, is good, but I always dreamed of making a free system. And this third way - the program I wrote, is the first step towards fulfilling the dream of creating my application for controlling expenses.

## Project

### Site Users Goal
The user of 'Utility Control 3' wants to have access to an intuitive application that saves utility bills and calculates daily usage.

### User Stories
I have included some user stories to clarify why particular feature matters. These will then be tested and confirmed in the [Testing](<#testing>) section.

- As a user, I want to be able to add expense entries.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete an expense entry in case of erroneous entries.
- As a user, I want to have access to the function to calculate the statistics of the average consumption of funds for a communal service per day.
- As a user, I want to be able to view a table with all expense records.
- As a user, I want to have an easy way to return to the main menu.

### Site Owners Goal
The goal of the site owner is to provide an application where the user can enter utility expense data in a simple way, access all expense records, view expense statistics, and delete the entry in case of incorrect input.

## User Experience (UX)

The 'Utility Control 3' application has a command line interface with a custom theme. The color scheme is selected in such a way as to be intuitive to the user and highlight: errors, successful input, selection menu, differences in selection options, the input that must be made for this selection, menu headings.

### Site Structure

[Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Game](https://sergii-kostanets.github.io/codeinstitute-rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock/) website has only one page:

* [Main](index.html)

The [main](index.html) page is the default loading page of the game.

### Design Choices

* #### Typography

    The font chosen was 'Rubik' for for inscriptions in the game.
  * 'Rubik' font corresponds to the spirit of the game, perfectly conveys the mood and goes well with the selected icons.
  * Highlighting with different colors allows you to create an intuitive interface that contrasts well with itself and the background.

* #### Colour Scheme

  * The color palette is bright and colorful, emphasizing the entertaining style of the game based on pure randomness without any elements of strategy or tactics.
  * The colors of the main icons of the game are taken as a basis.

* #### Main section

    The main section consists of three blocks.
  * On the left is a rule scheme that immediately changes to the symbol chosen by the player. Intuitively, it becomes clear that this is the choice of the player in the current round.
  * In the middle is a block consisting of three parts.
    * The number of points scored by the player. When the number of points reaches 10, the game ends with the player winning.
    * The timer starts counting down the first time a player is selected. When the timer reaches zero, the game ends.
    * The number of points scored by the computer. When the number of points reaches 10, the game ends with the player losing.
  * On the right is a scheme with rules that changes by itself some time after the choice of a player in each round. It is intuitively clear that this is the choice of the computer.
